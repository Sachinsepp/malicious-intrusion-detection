# 🚨 Real-Time Malicious Intrusion Detection

## 🔍 Overview
This project presents an advanced, intelligent intrusion detection and attack mitigation framework tailored for IoT-empowered cybersecurity systems. Utilizing the UNSW-NB15 dataset and deep learning methodologies—notably Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)—the system is engineered to detect, classify, and respond to real-time network threats and anomalies across smart infrastructures.

A Tkinter-based GUI streamlines user interactions, supporting dataset upload, preprocessing, training, and prediction—enabling seamless integration into real-world cybersecurity operations.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Leverage GANs to identify and simulate cyberattacks in IoT networks.
- Enhance cybersecurity through real-time detection and classification of intrusions.
- Provide visual feedback and intelligent recommendations based on attack patterns.
- Offer a modular, extensible framework suitable for academic research, industry, or internships.

## 🌐 Key Features

- 📁 **Dataset Upload**: User-friendly interface to upload UNSW-NB15 in CSV format.
- ⚙️ **Automated Preprocessing**: Feature normalization, label encoding, and shuffling.
- 📊 **Train-Test Split**: Robust data partitioning using `train_test_split` (80/20 split).
- 🧠 **Deep Learning with GANs**: Anomaly detection and classification using advanced adversarial learning.
- 🔍 **Attack Prediction**: Real-time prediction of malicious intrusions.
- 📈 **Metrics & Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, and visual graphs.
- 📊 **Visualization Tools**: Interactive plots for performance analysis and comparison.
- 💾 **Model Persistence**: Model weights and training history saved via pickle.
